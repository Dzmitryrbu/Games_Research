The Strimchik online store sells computer games all over the world. Historical game sales data, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) are available from public sources. It is necessary to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.  Data provided up to 2016. Let's say it's December 2016 and we're planning a campaign for 2017. It is necessary to work out the principle of working with data.  The abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) comes across in the data set - this is an association that determines the age rating of computer games. The ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it to an appropriate age rating, such as Mature, Toddler, or Teen.
